When I was introduced to the project and was told to start researching,
I did not know where to begin. I did not exactly know what I was going to
make and what tool would use to make it. Also, I reasoned with myself that
thinking about what I want to make first would make it easier for me to
decide what tool or tools I would need to learn. I started by thinking of
what I am passionate about, which is helping people. I wanted to create
something to help the general public, so I started to think about
problems that I see occur in my life and others.

<p>
The first problem I thought of revolved around medicine/vitamins.
I originally was thinking of making medicine research app that would allow
you to search symptoms you are having and medicines that would heal the
symptoms would appear as results. Each medicine that is recorded in the
app would show the name, purpose,  times to take, and other information.
I was tired of constantly asking my parents, who are a nurse and a
pharmacist, about what medicine I should take when I have a headache or
stomachache. However, because they were in the medical field, I did not
think of how other people would find this information, and after asking a
few friends on how they would go about this problem, I realized that with
the internet and Google, someone can easily research what medicines they
should be taking.
</p>

<p>
After this, I thought of another problem that I was noticing. In my life,
I have observed that I constantly forget to take the vitamins that I
should be taking daily and also forget to take the medicine that is
prescribed to me when I am sick. I've also seen this happen to family
members and friends, and this inspired me to think of a solution. I want
to create an app where you can store all the medicine and vitamins you
have to take and the days and times you have to take them. When it is
time to take them, the app will send a notification saying which one you
have to take.
</p>

<p>
This being said, I believe I am still in the early stages. I still want
to think of other features that could be added to the app to make it even
more useful. After figuring this out. I will start to research in-depth
what tools I would need to learn in order to make this app a reality.
