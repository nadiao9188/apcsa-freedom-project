Since writing blog entry one, my group members and I have been tinkering with different tools and resources that we could use for our project. However, before we even started, we thought about what our goal was, which was to create an android app that reminded its users when to take their medication. We knew that we wanted the user to be able to save the medications they inputted, so we decided that we would have to learn Firebase. While one of my group members started following tutorials for that (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kRgVxULbag)(https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/password-auth), my other group member and I started with finding out about how we were going to make the app.
</p>

<p>
We did not know where to start, so we simply searched on Google, "How to make an android app". This brought us to the answer that we would be using Java. On one of the results, we saw that there was an IDE called Android Studio, where we can use Java to create our app. We downloaded it onto the computer and opened up the application.
</p>


<p>
At first glance at Android Studio, we had no idea what we were looking at, so one of my group members suggested that we look up tutorials on how to use it. We started following the tutorials on the website MindOrks(https://blog.mindorks.com/introduction-to-android-studio-ide), and we started tinkering with how to change the display of the app. After following the video and website tutorials and tinkering with the IDE, we decided that this is what we were going to use for our app and noticed how what we are learning in class in Edhesive can be applied to our app. For example, we have learned how to save data inputted from the user into variables so we can use it in later parts of the code. We can use this to save the names of the medicines that users input into our app and apply it to other functions of the app, like saving information under the correct medicine name and notifying the user what medicine they have to take.
</p>


<p>
Currently, we are on the fourth step of the engineering design process, which is planning the most promising solution. We have decided what we are going to use, and now we are going to learn how to use our tools, plan out what we want our app to look like, and what how the app will function. Since starting tinkering, I have learned to develop skills that are not only needed for this project, but for outside the classroom as well. I have learned my group and I need to work on collaboration to be succesful in this app. We were having difficulty communicating with each other and deciding who would be responsible for the different things we had to accomplish. We also had trouble with time management and how long we should spend on each resource that we found. Learning how to improve on time management and communication will help me with other tasks that I have to accomplish and will teach me how being more efficient and affect other people.
