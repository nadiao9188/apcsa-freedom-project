## Updates, Progress, and Knowledge
Since my last blog post, Elizabeth, Aaliyah and I were finally able to create an “alarm”. We were able to get a clock to show up on the screen, where the user would be able to choose what time they would want a notification to come in. Above the clock is where the user can change what the notification would display to show the name of the medicine, and there is a set and cancel button at the bottom. We had tested this alarm multiple times, but the notifications would not show up at the exact time that the alarm was set and would appear a few minutes ahead. Other than this problem, we finally had an MVP.

After completing our MVP, we went further in the design of the app by creating an opening page where the name of the app would slide onto the screen before opening up the page where the user would create the alarm.

This is a walkthrough of our app

## Engineering Design Process
We are now on the 7th step of the Engineering Design Process, **improve as needed**, and we are adding any extra components that would make the user have a better experience using the app, like the opening page. Me and my group will continue to work on our app and fixing any problems that come up.

## Skills
Due to the recents events of the COVID-19 pandemic, my group and I have been improving our skills of **communication** and **time management**. Staying on top of all our work can be hard while constantly being at home, but we have tried to keep each other accountable for the work that we still have to get done.

## Next Steps
With our MVP completed, all we can do it to keep improving our app to make it the best it can be. Even during the current situations, we will continue to fix any problems while staying safe.
